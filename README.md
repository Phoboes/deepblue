# Deepblue

A work in progress for visualising the *actual* depth of the ocea.

Facts and scaling are (mostly) there (as is a fancy SVG human for scale)

Todo:

Create a bunch of SVGs to animate out at certain depths (i.e the eiffel tower inverted for 301 meters).
Create a reuseable animation splashpage function for each of these.

During the day sonar would indicate depths for 300-500  meters, but during the evenings, it appeared to rise.<br/>This turned out to be sonar bouncing off of the swim bladders of millions of fish which, during daylight, keep to the relative safety of the depths, rising to feed under the cover of night.",
